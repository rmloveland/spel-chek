* SPEL-CHEK

This is a simple spell-checker, written in Emacs Lisp. Right now it is
essentially a (bad?) translation of the Python code by Peter Norvig,
discussed [[http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html][here]]. Certainly it runs much more slowly.

The name =spel-chek= is a reference to the fact that this is an
incomplete or otherwise less-featureful checker than others. In large
part it is a pet project where I learn more about Lisp
programming. It's also a mis-spelled word in its own right. Funny
stuff, I know.
