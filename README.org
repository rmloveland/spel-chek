* SPEL-CHEK

This is a simple spell-checker, written in Emacs Lisp. Right now it is
essentially a (bad?) translation of the Python code by Peter Norvig,
discussed [[http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html][here]]. Certainly it runs much more slowly.

Also, it doesn't currently export any user-accessible functionality,
and needs to be loaded into =*ielm*=, at which point you can play with
various functions, etc. In other words, it's an 'alpha' project that's
still under development. There's enough here to start playing with,
though. It even corrects a few simple spelling errors.

The name =spel-chek= is a reference to the fact that this is an
incomplete or otherwise less-featureful checker than others. In large
part it is a pet project where I learn more about Lisp
programming. It's also a mis-spelled word in its own right. Funny
stuff, I know.
