* Desired Features, Notes, &c.
1. The ability to write the =*spel-words= hash table to disk would be
   nice. Hate to retrain every time.

2. An implementation of the Soundex algorithm. On a related note, I'd
   like to modify the existing functions like =spel-edit-distance-1=
   to refrain from adding elements to the lists they generate that are
   obviously not necessary.
